README for xfkc


NOTES

  Running XfKC from the menu, or from the command line will run the
  configuration GUI. To apply the configuration, you need to run:
  $ xfkc --apply

  You can change your ~/.config/xfce4-session/xfce4-sessionrc file to apply the
  configuration at Xfce startup. If you use the xkb panel plugin, make sure to
  run xfkc before the panel, or the xkb plugin will crash.
