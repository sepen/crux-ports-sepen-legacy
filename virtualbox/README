README for virtualbox 1.3.8

REQUIREMENTS

Kernel headers needed for build 'vboxdrv.ko' kernel module.

PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

During installation 'vboxdrv.ko' has been installed to your modules directory
and you can load it using modprobe vboxdrv. 
Also make sure you give yourself read and write access to /dev/vboxdrv.
Before run virtualbox you need to load the kernel module (vboxdrv.ko)

PRECAUTION

The only way to run virtualbox now is using the root user, but future releases
of this port will try to fix this problem. (e.g: using sUID permissions on 
binaries, or by adding some udev rules to /dev/vboxdrv )
