README for virtualbox 1.3.8

REQUIREMENTS

  Kernel headers needed for build 'vboxdrv.ko' kernel module.

PRE-INSTALL

  Add a new group wich can use VirtualBox
  # groupadd vboxusers (or run pre-install script)

POST-INSTALL

  Add your user to the vboxusers group
  # usermod -G vboxusers <your_user> 
  
  During installation 'vboxdrv.ko' has been installed to your modules directory
  and you can load it using modprobe vboxdrv (needed before run VirtualBox).
  Also make sure you give yourself read and write access to /dev/vboxdrv.

  Also is a good idea to fine tune and check your udev rules.
  For getting some info from your system run udevinfo:
  # udevinfo -a -p /sys/class/misc/vboxdrv

  Udevinfo starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
  walks up the chain of parent devices. It prints for every device
  found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format.
  A rule to match, can be composed by the attributes of the device
  and the attributes from one single parent device.

    looking at device '/class/misc/vboxdrv':
    KERNEL=="vboxdrv"
    SUBSYSTEM=="misc"
    SYSFS{dev}=="10:62"
