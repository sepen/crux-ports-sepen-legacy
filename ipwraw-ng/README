REQUIREMENTS

  KERNEL
  
  * Make sure that the following capabilities are ENABLED:
  (see /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux/autoconf.h)
  
  #define CONFIG_FW_LOADER 1
  
  The driver loads the microcode image via the Linux firmware hotplug capability
  
  Device Drivers ->
    Generic Driver Options ->
      Hotplug firmware loading support

  
  * Make sure that the following capabilities are *NOT* ENABLED:

  #define CONFIG_IPWRAW 1

  If existing support is built into your kernel, you must disable that
  capability and rebuild your kernel before upgrading the drivers.
  
  Device Drivers ->
    Network device support ->
      Network device support (NETDEVICES [=y]) ->
        Wireless LAN (non-hamradio) ->
          Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection

  
  NOTE:  If the driver is supported as a module (this would show up as
  #define CONFIG_IPWRAW_MODULE 1), you do not need to rebuild your kernel,
  but you will need to remove the binary module and relevant include files
  (see UPGRADING FROM PRIOR VERSIONS, below).


  SYSFS

  You will also need to have sysfs mounted.  This facility is used to query
  and control the operation of the driver. You can mount sysfs this by adding
  an entry to /etc/fstab similar to this:
  
  none            /sys            sysfs   defaults                0       0
