*** NOTE for ati with udev ***

If using udev, add your user to the "video" group to be able to use 3D.


POST-INSTALL

Use opt/gl-select from ports to select the correct gl/glx
libraries and extensions like so:

        # gl-select ati

Also to configure your X server you can execute ati configurator like this:

	# aticonfig --initial --input=/etc/X11/xorg.conf


POST-REMOVE

Use opt/gl-select from ports to revert to the x11 gl/glx libraries
and extensions like so:

        # gl-select x11


When UPGRADING/DOWNGRADING the ati-driver port (where the version changes),
use gl-select to revert to x11 and then re-select ati in order to
refresh the libGLcore and libGL symlinks, like so:

        # prt-get update ati
        # gl-select x11; gl-select ati
