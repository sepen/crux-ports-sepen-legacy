PRECAUTION

  On some systems EAGLE 5.x can have problems with the graphics performance.
  For solving these issues, please check the file xorg.conf. If it is the case
  that the composite extension is enabled or not explicitly disabled in the
  file, change the corresponding section or add the following lines:

    Section "Extensions"
         Option "Composite" "Disable"
    EndSection

  Further information can be found at
  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=227337

  Disabling the Composite Extension on Linux systems that work with xorg-x11
  packages of version 7.3 also avoids "X Error" messages that are shown while
  starting or closing EAGLE 5.x in a bash window.

  In the case the display gets corrupted when scrolling up or down in one of
  the Editor windows or in the EAGLE Control Panel, set the environment
  variable XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS to 1.
  This can be done, for example, with the help of a shell script:

    #!/bin/sh
    export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1 
    /usr/bin/eagle
