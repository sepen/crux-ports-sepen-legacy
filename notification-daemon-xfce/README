USAGE
  
  Notification-daemon-xfce is a dbus daemon, so to use it, you need a frontend
  application to trigger the daemon. This application is libnotify.

  Libnotify provides bindings for applications and also a small application to
  manually send messages to the daemon: notify-send.
  
  Using notify-send:
  
    For a first test pop up type
    $ notify-send "Test notification"
    
    For more information about using notify-send
    $ notify-send --help
