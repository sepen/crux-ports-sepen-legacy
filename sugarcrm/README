pre-install	
		If you have php port installed on your system, you don't need any extra port 
		to run sugarcrm. But if you have mod_php port installed you must install mysql 
		as a dependency.

		In both cases you must run mysql daemon, and then browse your crm url page
		(http://your.web.server/crm/) for begin the installation.
